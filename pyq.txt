QUESTION 11:
Data from an IoT device is transferred to cloud via a network, which is then processed at the cloud and then
a response is sent back to the IoT device from the cloud after processing. The time it takes for one-way data
transfer between the node and cloud is 10s and the data processing time at the cloud is ‘x’ seconds. It takes
a total of 25s for the entire to and fro transfer of data between the sensor and cloud along with processing
at the cloud. What is the value of x?
a. 10s
b. 5s
c. 15s
d. 20s

Correct Answer: b. 5s
Detailed Solution: Time taken for one-way data transfer between the node and cloud is 10s. Total time
taken for the data transfer is 25s. So 25=10+x+10 (transfer from node to cloud+processing at
cloud+transfer from cloud to node). Thus x = 5s.

QUESTION 12:
In IoT, temporal sensitivity of data plays an important role
a. True
b. False
Correct Answer: a. True
Detailed Solution: IoT data can be classified in to time sensitive data, less time sensitive data and data not
sensitive to time. Hence time sensitivity plays a big role in IOT data classification. Refer lecture 44 on Fog
Computing.
